      Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts, Commerce, and the Warrior God â€” among many other names. He was the Geo Archon and is the oldest of 'The Seven,' and possibly being one of the oldest, if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old. He is shrouded in a plethora of legends; both true and exaggerated, often depicting him as an all-conquering, powerful deity.
